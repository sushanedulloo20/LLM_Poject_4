        "in from Kavery’s land. But how could he do anything there, with this tough,\n",
        "no-nonsense woman working away?\n",
        "Guessing Kavery was hard up for money, he whispered to her,\n",
        "‘Sister, why\n",

        "once our family was very rich. Though we lost a lot of our money, much of it\n",
        "was also buried here, in this field by one ancestor, to keep it safe from\n",
        "robbers. Then people forgot about it for years and years. My husband found a\n",
        "clue to the location of the hidden treasure just a few days back. Why do you\n",

        "everyone thinks. I am actually looking for hidden treasure!’\n",
        "The thief was stunned. He felt this woman was really innocent, giving such\n",
        "important information to a stranger. He thought, why should I not take\n",
        "advantage of this situation? Here he was, hoping to steal a few coins from the\n",
        "temple, and this woman was telling him about hidden treasure! He replied in a\n",
        "very humble way,\n",
        "‘Y es sister, I understand; after all it is your family treasure.\n",
        "Only you should get it.\n",
        "’ He pretended to walk away, and went and hid himself\n",
        "a little way down the road.\n",
        "Night fell; Kavery packed up her tools and headed home. The temple, too,\n",
        "emptied out and the priest locked it up for the night. Then at midnight, when\n",
        "all was quiet and the night creatures were coming out of their homes, the thief\n",
        "crept into the field.\n",
        "All night he dug and dug, looking for treasure, but of course there was no\n",
        "sign of it as there never had been any treasure to begin with! By the time\n",
        "dawn broke he realized Kavery had made a fool of him and all he could do\n",
        "now was get away from the field fast.\n",
        "When Kavery reached the field she grinned to herself. Just as she had\n",
        "expected, the thief had spent the night digging up the land nicely for her. All\n",
        "she needed to do now was sow the seeds. She worked hard in the field for the\n",
        "next few months and managed to grow a good crop. She sold those and finally\n",
        "they had some money. With a part of this money Kavery bought some\n",

        "and advised the prime minister about many things. He researched how many\n",

        "him for a meeting, so he hopped into his horse carriage and set off for the\n",
        "office. Now George was always deep in thought and rarely noticed what was\n",
        "happening around him. Today, too, he sat in his carriage thinking about farms\n",
        "and ships and houses. But suddenly his carriage stopped with a jolt and he\n",
        "was shaken out of his thoughts. There was some commotion on the road and\n",
        "all carriages had stopped around him. Normally George would have just sunk\n",
        "back into his thoughts again, but today something stopped him. A horrible,\n",
        "strong smell. A smell that hung in the air and made you cover your nose with\n",
        "a hanky if you were not a scholar wrapped up in your own world.\n",
        "Today, somehow, George was not able to disconnect himself from what was\n",
        "going on around him. The smell kept wafting into his nose and taking his\n",
        "mind away from the problem he was tackling. He called out to his coachman,\n",
        "‘Hi John, what is this extraordinary smell?’\n",
        "John the coachman was used to his master’s absent-minded ways, and he\n",

        "George walked to the visitor’s room still thinking. He was sitting there,\n",
        "reflecting on horses and their dung, when the prime minister’s secretary came\n",
        "to meet him. Now Adam, the secretary, was not as learned as George, but he\n",
        "was very sharp and intelligent. He greeted George and said to him\n",
        "apologetically,\n",

        "will be late in seeing you. I hope you don’t mind waiting.\n",

        "carriages rushing up and down the road. Thinking he had perhaps not heard\n",
        "him, Adam cleared his throat and repeated loudly,\n",

        "’\n",
        "‘Y es, I heard you, Adam,\n",
        "’ George mumbled.\n",
        "Worried that this great thinker of the country was in some trouble, Adam\n",
        "asked gingerly,\n",
        "‘Is something bothering you? Perhaps I could help . . .?’\n",
        "George looked at him excitedly,\n",
        "‘Y ou know, I just looked into the future\n",
        "and realized we will all die in about a hundred years. Our country will be\n",
        "destroyed, our way of life gone forever. And do you know why? All because\n",
        "of horses . . . and their dung!’\n",
        "Adam stared at George, puzzled. Surely he could not be serious?\n",
        "George continued,\n",
        "‘See, now we use horses as the principal mode of\n",
        "transport in the country. They are used to draw carriages, in the king’s stables,\n",
        "even in the farms.\n",
        "’\n",
        "Adam nodded. This was true.\n",
        "‘So how many horses are there now? Let’s assume that there are 500 rich\n",
        "families who can afford to own a horse carriage. If each family has at least\n",
        "two children and all of them are rich enough to own carriages, that will mean\n",
        "a minimum of two more carriages in a few years. Each carriage would require\n",
        "two horses. So, each rich family would be using four horses at the least. So\n",
        "then there will be 2,000 horses. If you add our king’s cavalry, and the number\n",
        "of horses in the farms, the numbers increase substantially.\n",
        "’\n",
        "Adam nodded. Y es, this sounded true enough, but what was George’s\n",
        "point?\n",
        "‘How do we get rid of the dung they generate now?’\n",
        "Adam answered patiently,\n",
        "‘We dig pits and empty the dung into them.\n",
        "’\n",
        "George nodded,\n",
        "‘Now that’s my point. Imagine the scene a hundred years\n",
        "from now. 2,000 horses would have increased to 400,000, given the way the\n",
        "population is increasing. This will mean more dung! And what will we do\n",
        "with all this dung? Humans will need more space and houses and farming to\n",
        "sustain themselves. Where will we find open land to dig up and bury the\n",
        "dung? It will lie unattended everywhere and cause horrible diseases. If they\n",
        "make their way into the water sources it will be even worse. We will end up\n",
        "poisoning ourselves and our environment. We will become sick, and our\n",
        "country will become poor just by tending to so many sick people, and finally\n",
        "our way of life will just die out—as we all will. All because of horses!’\n",
        "Adam sat and thought about this for some time. George’s thoughts and the\n",
        "grim picture he had painted of the future was scary indeed. But . . . here\n",
        "Adam’s practical thinking kicked in; what if things did not work exactly the\n",
        "way George was seeing it? He turned to his friend and said,\n",
        "‘Mr Smith, you\n",
        "are not taking into account one very important bit into your calculations—the\n",
        "ability humans have to innovate and adapt. Many years ago there were no\n",
        "carts or carriages, we went everywhere by foot. Then once we started\n",
        "domesticating animals we realized we could use them for transport too. But\n",
        "do you think humans will rest with this achievement? Who knows, in a\n",
        "hundred years what other modes of transport we would have invented so that\n",
        "we may not require horse for transport at all. Perhaps we will even be able to\n",
        "fly like birds!’\n",
        "George never solved this problem in his lifetime. Neither did Adam live to\n",
        "see how true his thoughts about the future had been. Man went on to invent so\n",
        "many new ways of moving from place to place that horses are no longer used\n",
        "in the numbers they once were. James Watt invented the steam engine, which\n",
        "led to the invention of railways. Then cars were invented by Karl F. Benz and\n",
        "became widely used in cities for transport. Finally the Wright brothers\n",
        "showed that humans could fly—in aeroplanes! With all these great inventions,\n",
        "the horse and other animal-drawn carts and carriages are now a thing of the\n",
        "past.\n",
        "Truly, if man did not innovate and experiment, our species would have died\n",
        "out—just like George had predicted!\n",
        "Everyone was very happy this story. They all teased Meenu.\n",
        "‘Y ou are the\n",
        "George Smith of our house. Who knows one day nobody will eat pappadams\n",
        "and Amma may not prepare that many pappadams. We may even buy directly\n",
        "from the shops if it is a small number.\n",
        "’\n",
        "Meenu felt very embarrassed. She hid her face with a pillow. Ajji said,\n",
        "‘Don’t make fun of her. Foresight is very important. If you don’t have\n",
        "foresight, then you will land up in trouble like Ramu.\n",

        "the garden. I will wait for you there. When you enter the garden you will be\n",

        "the time the king had told them, the guards opened the gates and handed out\n",
        "the sacks. Men, women and children started roaming around the beautiful\n",
        "garden. They spotted juicy apples and plump mangoes hanging from trees.\n",
        "They picked these till they saw ripe pomegranates bursting with juice, grapes\n",
        "and colourful flowers no one had seen before. People went about picking\n",
        "whatever they wished for and filling their sacks with them.\n",
        "But as they walked further into the garden it became wilder, more like a\n",
        "forest, and there they saw trees laden with apples of gold, mangoes of silver\n",
        "and flowers studded with gems and jewels!\n",
        "Everyone emptied their sacks of the fruits they had collected earlier and\n",
        "started madly filling them up with these precious fruits and flowers. They all\n",

        "Greed took over, their minds and all they could think about was adding more\n",
        "and more valuables to their sacks. The fruits which they had picked earlier,\n",
        "and had tasted to be as sweet as nectar, now lay in heaps around the garden—\n",
        "forgotten and left to rot.\n",
        "Then with their sacks filled right to the top, the citizens made their way to\n",
        "the rear gate of the garden where the king was waiting. But what was this? To\n",
        "their astonishment they found a raging stream stopping their way. Water\n",
        "gushed down from behind some rocks and rushed over pebbles and big\n",
        "boulders through the garden. The stream was narrow, but the current was\n",
        "strong. There were no boats to take the people across. Clearly, the only way\n",
        "was to swim. But how could they swim with such heavy sacks filled with gold\n",
        "and silver fruits?\n",
        "The people stood by the stream for a long time scratching their heads. Then\n",
        "one young man did what they all knew needed to be done. He simply\n",
        "abandoned his sack by the stream, waded into the water, then swam across to\n",
        "the other side. Slowly the others, too, followed suit. Sadly, some wailing in\n",
        "distress, they left their sacks filled with what they had thought was the riches\n",
        "of a lifetime, and dived into the stream. Then they walked up to their king—\n",
        "wet, unhappy and angry.\n",
        "King Amrit and Chandan watched them trudge up in their soaking clothes.\n",
        "Chandan had a small smile on his lips, while the king looked sad. When they\n",
        "had assembled in front of him, he said,\n",
        "‘When I asked you yesterday if you\n",
        "were happy with your lives, all of you said you were contented and did not\n",
        "need anything more. Y et, today I can see the sadness in your faces when you\n",
        "had to leave behind the riches you had gathered in my garden. If you were\n",
        "really happy with your lives, why did you gather the jewel fruits, and why are\n",
        "you so sad now?’\n",
        "Everyone looked down, ashamed at their behaviour. Only the young man\n",
        "who was the first to cross the stream after leaving his sack behind seemed to\n",
        "be unconcerned. Chandan spotted his cheerful face in the crowd and\n",
        "beckoned him forward. Then he asked,\n",
        "‘Tell me, are you not sad you had to\n",
        "leave behind so much of wealth that suddenly came your way?’\n",
        "The man said,\n",
        "‘I didn’t pick the jewelled fruits and flowers. I had picked\n",
        "some of the lovely, tasty fruits and had eaten my fill of them. In my sack I had\n",
        "kept some others for my little daughter who is at home. I had thought she\n",
        "would enjoy these tasty apples and mangoes. But when I saw there was no\n",
        "other way to go across the stream, I did not think twice about leaving my sack\n",
        "by the river. My little girl can get tasty fruits from some other garden, too!\n",
        "But I am so happy the king let us all wander around his garden, looking at the\n",
        "trees and plants and animals. He is a great king for having created this place\n",
        "of beauty, and it was a pleasure walking around there.\n",
        "’\n",
        "Finally a smile appeared on King Amrit’s face. Chandan turned to him and\n",
        "said,\n",
        "‘Y our Majesty, I hope you now realize that people’s contentment does\n",
        "not end with having enough food or money. They also need to be truly happy\n",
        "inside. Only then will they not be swayed when they gain or lose wealth. That\n",
        "is a lesson that everyone—whether a king or a commoner—needs to\n",
        "remember.\n",
        "’\n",
        "The king nodded, as did his subjects. This was a lesson they would not\n",
        "forget in a hurry!\n",
        "‘Did you like the story, Meenu?’ Raghu asked.\n",
        "‘Oh yes,\n",
        "’ Meenu nodded.\n",
        "‘But I liked the minister more than the king!’\n",
        "‘That’s true, Meenu,\n",
        "’ Ajji agreed.\n",
        "‘Kings did need intelligent ministers to\n",
        "show them the right path sometimes. Remember Akbar had Birbal, and\n",
        "Krishnadevaraya had Tenali Rama? Why just kings, we all need someone to\n",
        "tell us if what we are doing is wrong. It could be our parents, grandparents,\n",
        "teachers or even our best friend. The important thing is to listen to them and\n",
        "change our ways when needed.\n",
